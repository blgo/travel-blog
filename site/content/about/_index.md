Kitty R. was created in 2015 during another hitch-hiking trip with Grandpa T. through Morocco.
Even before that time she had already been traveling quite a lot... from Scandinavia to the
Iberian Peninsula or Asia Minor.
With a rucksack, by hitchhiking and sleeping everywhere.
Now, as she moves to completely new for her destinations, she has decided to share her little
adventures.

She confirms that all of the described stories actually happened. Although reading may require
the use of imagination...

Feedback and comments are very welcome and much appreciated; Kitty treats them as a good base for further improvement and development! Thank you!

I need a change... 
KittyR has a long history background and as I am thinking of making videos more regularly and more pro, I guess it's time to change the account name into something rezonating better with myself these days and in direction I am heading towards.
What would you say to Hop Hop travels?  As when you hop on... or call someone in the woods, hey hey hop hop! üßê 
Let me know what you think as at the end I am creating videos for mine and  yours pleasure ! üíï

Kitty R. was created in 2015 during another hitch-hiking trip with Grandpa T. through Morocco.
Even before that time she had already been traveling quite a lot... from Scandinavia to the
Iberian Peninsula or Asia Minor.
With a rucksack, by hitchhiking and sleeping everywhere.
Now, as she moves to completely new for her destinations, she has decided to share her little
adventures.

She confirms that all of the described stories actually happened. Although reading may require
the use of imagination...

Feedback and comments are very welcome and much appreciated; Kitty treats them as a good base for further improvement and development! Thank you!

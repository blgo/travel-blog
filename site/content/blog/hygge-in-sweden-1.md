title: Hygge in Sweden
description: I have been coming to Sweden since I was a child. It so happened
  that my grandmother's sister married a Swede and that's how it started...
  Sweden and Norway entered my heart when I was a little child! Today I'm taking
  you to Sweden, a country of amazing nature - lakes, forests and wildlife. We
  will go on a truly Scandinavian fishing trip and I will show you why Sweden is
  a paradise for nature lovers

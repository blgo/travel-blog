American dream. Man all his life watched American films, drank Cola, wore jeans until one day he woke up in a black convertible, rushing through California. During the week we visit two national parks, we give an interview standing on Walk of Fame, fry fluffy pancakes and laugh at the tears on Secret Comedy. The latter, thanks to the good and tasty jokes of Standper, shows us the state and its inhabitants. A wonderful thing. And my dream of a longer road trail around national parks has already become as enormous as the sequoices in the pictures. Well, I recommend the United States. They have fun here.

Japan. I always lived in the belief that this was the only country I have never been to, but I felt that I could live here. And now we arrived spontaneously in Tokyo, so it's time to verify my image.
I don't understand many things and the situation here. Even with the simplest sign, I break down on letters. It remains for me to nod my head politely and try to keep it nicely.
At every step I feel that it is incredibly calm here. As if silence in the forest, only in the city. Nowhere else I felt such patience in the crowd here. A wave of people does not tire me, I just swim calmly in it. Strange!
I am also glad that we stopped at Asakus, a little further from the center. Cyclists sneak even slower and quieter here. And we walk with empty streets so beautiful that where I will not turn around the magic frame.
And still food. What are these wonderful flavors; From grilled mackerel, tartare from Tu√±czyk, toast with beef, to even a sandwich with strawberries. Everything is surprising and umami. So many and so many first impressions.

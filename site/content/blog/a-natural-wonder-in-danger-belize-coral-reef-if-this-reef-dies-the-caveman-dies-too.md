title: " A natural wonder in danger - Belize Coral Reef! If this reef dies, the
  Caveman dies too! "
description: "Caveman is an extraordinary man who charmed me with his knowledge,
  charisma and modesty. He runs a snorkeling company on the Caribbean island of
  Caye Caulker in Belize. Caveman is very concerned about the future of the
  coral reef, talks about it with passion and tries to spread knowledge on how
  to take care of the reef and animals during the tour. In this film he tells us
  how he accidentally jumped on a crocodile, where the name Caveman comes from
  and what we, visitors to the island, can do for the coral reef and the animals
  living here. I highly recommend listening to a conversation with this
  incredibly interesting man!  #underwaterworld #environmental

No travels... no problem. Let me take the biggest video challenge on - film the town I actually live in at the moment! Let me show you Bristol from a local perspective. Thank you Tomasz, you are the best video buddy ever! :)

PS. This was an exeptional weekend in Bristol. After many months the warm sun has shown up and people just went outside to enjoy the sun. Trust me, it was not a typical lockdown day in Bristol.

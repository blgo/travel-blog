My dream became reality today and expectations were exceeded as we had the cenotes literally just to ourselves ðŸ¥¹ I feel truly touched by the absolute silence so we could hear every single drop and the unbelievably clear deep waters in all variations of blue... The ancient Maya believed that cenotes were sacred portals to the underworld, and they used them for rituals and ceremonies, including communicating with gods and ancestors... Unforgetable and refreshing experience.

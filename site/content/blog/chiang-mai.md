Dear Reader, 

Have you ever wondered how many things and emotions you can experience in just one day?  Have you ever felt sensory overload? That's what Kitty R. feels while travelling; so many things, emotions, details, happening around her all the time! Chiang Mai in Thailand is a great example of that feeling, that's why instead of writing today, she has decided to present you One Day in this town. 

Enjoy and please leave a feedback comment, so she knows what you think about her new passion making and editing videos. 

With love, 

Kitty R.

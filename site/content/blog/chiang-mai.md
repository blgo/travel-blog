Have you ever wondered how many things and emotions you can experience in just one day?  Have you ever felt sensory overload? That's what Kitty R. feels while travelling; so many things, emotions, details, happening around her all the time! Chiang Mai in Thailand is a great example of that feeling, that's why instead of writing today, she has decided to present you One Day in this town.

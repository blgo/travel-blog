title: Lake Atitlan - was it really that special?
description: San Pedro de Laguna on Lake Atitlan. I have had very mixed feelings
  since we arrived here. Supposedly beautiful natural circumstances; we are at
  an altitude of about 1600m above sea level, on the great Lake Atitlan
  surrounded by mountains and 3 volcanoes. The last eruption of Atitlan took
  place in 1853, so I put aside the fear sown by the earthquake in Antigua that
  I had just experienced and turn it into an inactive volcano of emotions.

San Pedro de Laguna on Lake Atitlan. I have had very mixed feelings since we arrived here. Supposedly beautiful natural circumstances; we are at an altitude of about 1600m above sea level, on the great Lake Atitlan surrounded by mountains and 3 volcanoes. The last eruption of Atitlan took place in 1853, so I put aside the fear sown by the earthquake in Antigua that I had just experienced and turn it into an inactive volcano of emotions. Lake Atitlan itself is of natural origin, located in a crater, with a surface area of ​​130km2. It is also the deepest lake in Central America. This region lives mainly from tourism, and since the 60s has attracted many hippies. And you can feel it. When I was looking for a place with a massage to improve my health, the places that offered reiki and other supposedly healing powers caught my eye first. By the way, I also read that you can only go to nearby highlands and volcanoes with a guide, because there are a lot of robberies along the way. I also read that recently it is a lie, that the guides and transport drivers themselves, not wanting to lose their jobs, are fueling this fear. I don't know and I won't check, because I'm just a lazy bum, maybe with bad knees, who physically won't climb a volcano by herself anyway. With or without the risk of being attacked. We also tried to sign up for a Spanish school three times. In the first place, all the lessons were booked 2 weeks in advance. In the second one, found on Google, we found a few empty tables and a school board among the bushes by the lake. Apart from that, no one. So we went to another Spanish school. There, in turn, we walked down a pissed-on alley until we reached an empty office. And there again, no one, only two sad water turtles in a children's bath tub. They were so tight that they were stuck in the same trapped position all the time, unable to pass each other, let alone swim. There was also a huge and lonely carp in a small, dirty aquarium. He seemed happy to see us, but for us it was only a sad experience. Surely we won't take him in? With a carp through Central America? (...)

title: Flores, Tikal &  Semuc Champey
description: "This is the first city in Guatemala we visit. We stayed in the
  outskirts of the town, so we quickly became friends with Mario, the tuk tuk
  driver. Flores is also a base for trips to Tikal, the Mayan ruins. We went
  there with a guide, which was a good idea. A few intense hours of walking
  through the jungle and admiring the ruins is a great experience; especially
  since we also see an anteater, coatis, howler monkeys and a local falcon. And
  from the top of one of the ruins we admired the dense, deep green expanse of
  the jungle.We have also visted Lanquin and had the best magical experience
  when swimming in Semuc Champey! Watch the video to join us on this incredible
  adventure :)   #semucchampey #lanquin #guatemalatravel #secretsofguatemala

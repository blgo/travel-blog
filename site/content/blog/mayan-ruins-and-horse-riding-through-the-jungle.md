title: "Mayan ruins and horse riding through the jungle ! "
description: "San Ignacio, a border town in Belize, from which, in good weather,
  you can see Guatemala. It is here that we visit the Mayan ruins - Cahal Pech
  and go on a horseback ride through the jungle. Along the way, we learn about
  poisonous and medicinal plants, see local woodpeckers and iguanas, vultures
  circling the field, and termite nests high in the trees. We saw guava trees,
  lime trees, local cherries, dragon fruit, tamarind and many others. Jose
  recommended the latter as a local drink to try if we have the chance -
  tamarind juice with rum. I invite you to the episode!  #belize #sanignacio

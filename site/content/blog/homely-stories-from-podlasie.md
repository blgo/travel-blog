title: " Homely stories from Podlasie"
description: Here is the second part of the film from my time in Poland. In this
  part, we will look at Podlasie and listen to the homely stories of  Warsaw
  people from Podlasie. The boys will tell us what the "exodus" is, how the
  village has changed over the years and how the old cottages were taken over by
  nature. We will also take a drive around the area and run away from the
  horseflies. I am absolutely delighted with Podlasie, and the only thing I
  regret is that we did not manage to record the howling wolves that we heard at
  night. Enjoy watching  and please leave a comment, so I know if I should
  continue with making videos! ðŸ™‚
